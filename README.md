# Weather-App

I have created a Weather App for website using HTML CSS and JavaScript. We are getting the current weather data from Fess API fey from OpenWeatherMap and display the weather information like Temperature,  Weather condition, Humidity and Wind Speed according to the city on our website or app.
We are displaying the weather info on website from Free API using JavaScript.
In this weather app I`ve added one search box where user can enter the city name and get the weather information of the particular city.
